Description: Genetic cell classification is extremely important no matter in medical or biological fields. We design an antoencoder network to learn the parameters of the model, and use the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution as the loss function for better feature selection. Then we put the trained parameters into the zero-inflated negative binomial linear discriminant model, which based on the Bayesian model. Finally, the category of the sample is determined according to the discriminant score.  When calling into 'Python', these packages are required tensorflow-gpu==1.15.0 keras==2.3.1 numpy==1.19.1 scanpy==1.3.7 scikit-learn==0.23.1. The version of Python should be greater than or equal to 3.6.
